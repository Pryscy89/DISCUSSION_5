CLASS AND OBJECTS IN PYTHON


OVERVIEW

This lesson introduces how to create classes and objects in Python.

Instructions

The purpose of this repository is to make known how classes and objects can be created in Python. Likewise, these tasks will be of great help to better understand the use of classes and objects.

Important

The purpose is to show how classes and objects are created in Python. I will give a brief definition of what classes and objects are in Python and how we can use them.

As we well know, Python is an object-oriented programming language, and almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A class is a user-defined data type, and creating instances of a class is about creating objects of that type. Classes and objects are considered the main building blocks for Python.

Warmup Tasks

TASK 01

When creating a class you need the keyword  class:

Specifications

1.- Open a new Jupyter notebook

2.- Create a Class called Number

3.- With a property named 'y' and assign the value 2

4.- Print the results as shown below

Expected Output

>> print(Number)

<class '__main__.Number'>

TASK 02

Creating objects in Python

1.- Use the same new Jupyter notebook

2.- Create a Class called Number

3.- With a property named 'y' and assign the value 2

4.- Create an object named result=Number()

5.- Print the value of y: 

Expected Output

>> print(Number.y)

2

TASK 03

Creation of Class with attributes using the __init__() function.

1.- Open a new Jupyter Notebook

2.- Create a Class called Person

3.- Use the __init__() function to assign values for name and lastname 'def __init__(self,name,lastname):
"All functions defined within a class must have at least one argument, 
which by convention is called self and is a reference to the class instance."

4.- Assign values to object properties for example: p1 = CAR("Jeep", 2021)

5.- Print the result.


Expected Output

>>print(p1.name)

Mauro

>>print(p1.lastname)
