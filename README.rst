This lesson introduces how to create classes and objects in Python.

Instructions

The purpose of this repository is to make known how classes and objects can be created in Python. Likewise, these tasks will be of great help to better understand the use of classes and objects.

Important

The purpose is to show how classes and objects are created in Python. I will give a brief definition of what classes and objects are in Python and how we can use them.

As we well know, Python is an object-oriented programming language, and almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A class is a user-defined data type, and creating instances of a class is about creating objects of that type. Classes and objects are considered the main building blocks for Python.
